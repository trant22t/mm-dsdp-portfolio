# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews 
This project, inspired by the 'sentiment' package by Timothy Jurka, sought to explore how sentiment analysis is used to summarize the opinions and attitudes of Amazon consumers. Reviews are splitted into their polarity, either positive, negative, or neutral, as well their dominant emotion, like sad or fearful.
